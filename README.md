## Description

`ai-lyrics` is a JavaScript library that allows you to easily fetch song lyrics from various sources on the web. It utilizes Puppeteer, a headless browser automation tool, to scrape lyrics from search results and provides methods to retrieve lyrics by song title or by both song title and artist.

## Installation

You can install `ai-lyrics` via npm:

```bash
npm install ai-lyrics
```

## Usage

```javascript
const LyricsAI = require('ai-lyrics');

(async function() {
    try {
        // Specify the song title and artist
        const songTitle = "Lily";
        const artist = "Alan Walker";

        // Fetch lyrics by song title and artist
        const lyricsByTitleAndArtist = await LyricsAI.findLyricsBySongTitleAndArtist(songTitle, artist);
        console.log(lyricsByTitleAndArtist);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error:", error);
    }
})();
```

Running this example will log the lyrics of the song "Lily" by Alan Walker.
```
Lily was a little girl
Afraid of the big, wide world
She grew up within her castle walls
Now and then, she tried to run
And then on a night with the setting sun     
She went in the woods away
So afraid, all alone
They warned her, don't go there
There's creatures who are hidin' in the dark 
Then somethin' came creepin'
It told her, "Don't you worry, " just        
Follow everywhere I go
Top of all the mountains or valley low       
Give you everything you've been dreamin' of  
Just let me in, ooh
Everything you want in gold
I'll be the magic story you've been told     
And you'll be safe under my control
Just let me in, ooh
Just let me in, ooh
She knew she was hypnotized
And walking on cold, thin ice
Then it broke, and she awoke again
Then she ran faster and
Start screamin', "Is there someone out there?
Please help me, come get me"
Behind her, she can hear it say
Follow everywhere I go
Top of all the mountains or valley low
Give you everything you've been dreamin' of
Just let me in, ooh
Everything you want in gold
I'll be the magic story you've been told
And you'll be safe under my control
Just let me in, ooh
Just let me in, ooh
Everything you want in gold
I'll be the magic story you've been told
And you'll be safe under my control
Just let me in, ooh
Follow everywhere I go
Top of all the mountains or valley low
Give you everything you've been dreamin' of
Just let me in, ooh
Then she ran faster and
Start screamin', "Is there someone out there?
Please help me"
Just let me in, ooh
```
